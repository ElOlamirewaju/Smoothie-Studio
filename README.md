## Getting Started
Prereqs: Node.js 20+, npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

Useful scripts:
- `npm run dev` – start the dev server
- `npm run lint` – ESLint
- `npm run build` – production build (Turbopack)
- `npm start` – serve the built app

Environment: no required secrets. If you add runtime config, prefer `.env.local` (ignored by git).
